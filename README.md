# odin-etch-a-sketch
The etch-a-sketch project from the JavaScript basics section of The Odin Project.

17/05/23: First black and whiteprototype created and working
- Need to change resetButton function
- Need to create a function to generate a random colour and assign it to a row element the first time it is hovered over
- Need to add switch statement to test for classes on each row item to add a filter to it to gradually darken it
